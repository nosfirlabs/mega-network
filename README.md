a neural network to generate captcha images in python

### for experimental purpose only. does and works as it should!

a neural network with 2 input neurons, 3 hidden neurons, and 1 output neuron. It initializes the weights and biases of the network with random values, and then performs forward propagation to generate an output based on the input data.

The neural network uses the sigmoid activation function, which is defined in the sigmoid function. The sigmoid function takes a single input and returns a value between 0 and 1.

The code then performs the forward propagation by calculating the inputs and outputs of each layer of the network, starting with the input layer and ending with the output layer. It does this by multiplying the inputs by the weights and adding the biases for each neuron, and then passing the result through the sigmoid activation function.

After performing forward propagation, the code prints the output of the network, which is the value of the single output neuron.

This is a very simple example of a neural network implemented in C. In a real-world application, you would likely want to add more layers and neurons to the network, as well as implement a training algorithm like backpropagation to adjust the weights and biases of the network based on a labeled training dataset.
